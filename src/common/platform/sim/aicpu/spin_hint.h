/**
 * @file spin_hint.h
 * @brief Platform-specific spin-wait hint for AICPU (simulation)
 *
 * In simulation, all AICPU scheduler threads share a small number of host CPU
 * cores with AICore threads. Without explicit yielding, idle scheduler threads
 * in tight polling loops starve the AICore thread executing the actual kernel,
 * causing iteration-based timeouts (MAX_IDLE_ITERATIONS) before the kernel can
 * complete — especially on resource-constrained CI runners (e.g., 2 cores
 * running 13+ threads).
 *
 * Two mitigations live here. The CPU hint (pause/yield) plus sched_yield() let
 * the OS scheduler give time slices to threads doing real work, and
 * PLATFORM_MAX_IDLE_ITERATIONS below raises the idle cap well above the onboard
 * value so a slow CPU-sim task (e.g. matmul-heavy kernels) making real progress
 * is not mistaken for a deadlock.
