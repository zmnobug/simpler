# Codes with no end-to-end test

← [Device Error Codes](../device-error-codes.md)

Four codes and three stall sub-classes have no ST — not from neglect, but because
they cannot be provoked. Recording why, so the next person does not re-derive it
(the argument lives in `tests/st/runtime_fatal_codes/test_runtime_fatal_codes.py`):

- **103 ASYNC_REGISTRATION_FAILED** is structurally pre-empted. The AICore side caps
  at `MAX_COMPLETIONS_PER_TASK` (64) and latches **102** on the 65th condition, so
  the scheduler-side "more than 64" check that would raise 103 never sees enough
  messages. 103 is reachable only by corrupting the slab (UB) or a malformed message.
- **104 READY_QUEUE_OVERFLOW** guards an internal scheduler invariant. Every ready
  queue can hold the complete shipped task prefix and every task is routed to one
  queue exactly once, so a valid public submission cannot fill it. Reaching 104
  means the queue state or shipped task window is internally inconsistent; the
  scheduler latches the code because the rejected task would otherwise appear as a
  later forward-progress timeout.
- **10 SCOPE_TASKS_OVERFLOW** cannot be reached either. `scope_tasks_cap` is the sum
  of the per-ring windows, but each ring physically holds only `window - 1` tasks, so
  all rings together top out at `cap - PTO2_MAX_RING_DEPTH` — strictly below the cap.
  The rings always fill first and latch 1 or 3. Shrinking the window shrinks both, so
  the gap holds.
- **11 TENSORMAP_OVERFLOW** needs the 65536-entry pool (`PTO2_TENSORMAP_POOL_SIZE`,
  compile-time, not tunable via `runtime_env`) flooded *and* a stalled producer
  holding entries.
- **S4 / S5 / unknown**: not expressible through the public API. `set_dependencies()`
  can only name already-submitted tasks, so a dependency cycle cannot be written; a
  stuck producer is RUNNING (→ S1), never pure WAIT (S4). `total_tasks_` counts
  *submitted* tasks, so once they retire `completed == total` and the S5 watchdog
  never fires. They are kept as defensive labels: if a future bug produces the state,
  it gets named instead of mislabelled.

The name tables are held complete for these anyway
(`tests/ut/cpp/common/test_error_code_names.cpp`) — an unreachable code is exactly
the one that would otherwise print as a bare number on the day it finally fires.

If you do hit 10, 11, 103, 104, S4, S5 or unknown, it is a runtime bug. Keep the device
log and report it.
